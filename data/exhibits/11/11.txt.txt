(A)

A pigeon is deprived of food for some time.

The pigeon is placed in a standard experimental space where a feeding
mechanism filled with grain is presented occasionally for a few seconds.

The feeding mechanism or “food magazine” makes a characteristic
noise, and the food is illuminated while available.

Noiseand light from the magazine initially have no power to reinforce
behavior.  

On the other hand, food does reinforce any behavior it may follow.
(Food is an unconditioned or primary reinforcer.)

When the magazine has been operated many times, the pigeon imme-
diately responds to the noise and light by approaching and eating.

All food is removed from the feeding mechanism.
The empty magazine now operates only when a key is pecked.

Although the magazine is empty, the rate of pecking the key increases.
The sound and light of the magazine have evidently become conditioned
reinforcers (sometimes called secondary reinforcers ).

The sound and light became conditioned reinforcers when they were
repeatedly paired with food.

(K) When pecking the key continues to operate the empty magazine, the

rate declines.

(L) The sound and light of the magazine are no longer paired with food

and, through extinction, lose the power to reinforce.
