EXPERIMENT 1.

Pavlov placed a dog in a standard experimental situation. On repeated
conditioning trials a tone was sounded for 5 seconds, and approximately 2.
seconds later the dog was given powdered food. This pairing of tone and food
powder was repeated, with trials spaced from 5 to 85 minutes apart at random
intervals, for ﬁfty trials. Trials 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 were test trials, that
is, the tone was sounded for 30 seconds and no food powder was given.

EXPERIMENT 2. (Do not read Experiment 2 until instructed to do so.)

A dog had been conditioned to salivate to a metronome beating at 104 ticks
per minute. Several interspersed test trials (metronome ticking for 80 seconds
but not followed by food powder) provided approximately 10 drops of saliva
on each trial. The ticking metronome was then presented on every trial for
30 seconds without being paired with food powder. (Sufﬁcient time was
allowed between trials to avoid appreciable fatigue.) The results for this
series of consecutive trials without food are presented on the following table.
