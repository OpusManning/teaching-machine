EXPERIMENT 1.

(A) A water—deprived rat is reinforced with water on a variable-interval schedule
until responding stabilizes at a moderate rate — a base line on which anxiety

is to be observed.

(B) Every 10 minutes a buzzer sounds for 3 minutes.

(C) When the buzzer is first sounded, the rate of

lever pressing is decreased.

(D) Soon, the buzzer has no effect on rate.
(E) The rat is now shocked at the end of each 3-

minute buzzer period.

(F) Soon, when the buzzer sounds, the animal

begins to crouch and remains fairly immobile.
Erection of hair, defecation, etc., occur.

(G) Sample records taken at this stage are given

in Figure 1 marked “SALINE? The straight
arrow indicates the onset of the buzzer. The
broken arrow indicates the brief shock,
followed immediately by termination of the
buzzer.

(H) To isolate the performance in the presence of

(1)

(J)

the buzzer, the record is displaced downward
between the arrows.

Saline solution injected into the rat has no
effect. The performance is typical of unin-
jected rats.

Reserpine is a tranquilizer.

(K) Amphetamine is a stimulant.

EXPERIMENT 2.
(Wait until instructed to read Experiment 2.)
A food-deprived monkey receives food
after every twelfth pull of a chain. At the
same time, a lever is present which in the
past has been used in an avoidance procedure
(a response to it delayed shock 20 seconds).
In the session represented by the record in
Figure 2, the avoidance contingency was not

in effect but extinction is not yet complete. Periods of quiet and buzzer-terminated-
by-shock were alternated every 6 minutes. Between points 1 and 2 on Figure 2
the buzzer and shock remained off; then at point 2, the buzzer was sounded, con-
tinuing to point 3; at 8, a brief shock was presented and the buzzer was terminated.
