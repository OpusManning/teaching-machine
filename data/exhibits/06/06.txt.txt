Types of Response Mechanisms

Contractions of striated or striped muscles (so called because of their
appearance under a microscope) move parts of the skeletal frame, as well
as certain “flaps” of tissue such as the tongue, eyelid, and vocal cords.

Contractions of smooth muscles generally change the dimensions of various
internal organs.

Glands secrete ﬂuids into ducts or directly into the blood stream.
