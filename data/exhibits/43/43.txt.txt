(A)

A parent gives a child a small piece of candy, although the child has

not recently asked for candy.  
The child salivates and

eats the candy.

In the child’s history, getting and eating one piece of candy has usually
been followed by getting another piece.     .  

The child asks for more candy; but

although the parent usually gives more candy when asked, this time no
more candy is given. T

The child cries, his face grows red, and ﬁnally he has a temper tantrum.

Dinner is served a few minutes later, and the child eats less than usual.
