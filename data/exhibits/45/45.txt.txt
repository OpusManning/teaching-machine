Mrs. Frazier owned a dog which “asked to be let out or in” by whining
softly and then standing on its hind legs and throwing its forepaws
noisily against the door.

Mrs. Frazier occasionally opened the door when the dog “asked to be
let in or out?’

(C) After the house was repainted and the door beautifully reﬁnished, it

became important for Mrs.“ razier to keep the dog“: from scratching

the door.

So Mrs. Frazier started responding to the dogs ﬁrst faint whine, not

waiting for the jump against the door.

It was so easy to get in and out that the frequency of the behavior

increased, and Mrs. Frazier began to spend a good share of the day

  letting the dog in and out.   

Mrs. Frazier solved the problem by hanging a card bearing the letters

NO outside the door. The door was never opened when the card was
in place; but when the card was not in place, the door was opened as
soon as the dog whined.        

The card could be silently removed from the door through the mail slot.

The dog quickly stopped “asking to be let in” when the card was in place.
During this period, damage to the door was repaired. Henceforth,.when
it was convenient to let the dog in, Mrs. Frazier would remove the card.
At other times the dog stayed outside without whining or throwing it-
self against the door.    

Because it was no longer easy to get back in, the dog now “asked to be
let out” only infrequently. i  

Sometimes, after asking to be let out, the dog would see Mrs. Frazier

pick up the card to put: on the dor and would turn back andstay in

the house.
