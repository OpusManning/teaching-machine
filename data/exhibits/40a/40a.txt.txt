EXPERIMENT 1.

(A)

(B)

A food—deprived pigeon was placed in a standard experimental chamber
each day for a 1-hour session. Key pecking was reinforced with food
on a variable-interval schedule (average interval of 1 minute) until
rate of responding was stable from one day to the next.

This schedule of food reinforcement remained in effect throughout all
the experiments which follow.

(C) Smallelectrodes were inserted be-

neath the pigeon’s skin. Through
these electrodes a brief shock
(lasting 100 milliseconds) could be
delivered.

The last day of the variable-interval
schedule uncomplicated by punish-
ment can be seen in Figure 1 where
it is labeled “N o Punishment.”

On the next day, every response
was followed by a brief mild shock
(80 volts). The cumulative record
from this session is labeled
“Punishment (lst hour)” in Figure
1.

Every response continued to be punished through many daily sessions,
and the variable-interval schedule of food reinforcement remained in
effect. The cumulative record from the tenth session of continuous pun-
ishment is shown in Figure 1.
