This is a hungry pigeon in a standard experimental space, an enclosed rec-

tangular chamber or box. Stimuli eliciting reﬂex behavior may be neglected.
The pigeon eventually pecks the small disk-shaped key. The food magazine
operates automatically, making food available immediately after a peck
(response) on the key. We ob-
serve that when the pigeon has
peeked the key and received
food, it soon pecks again (and
receives food and pecks again,
etc.), i.e., the rate or frequency
of pecking is increased. Because
the rate increases when the re-
sponse is followed by food, food
is said to reinforce the response.
Food is called a reinforcer, and
the event reinforcement. Because
the response does not appear to
be produced by an eliciting stim-
ulus, it is said to be emitted. This
type of behavior, which operates
or acts upon the environment, is
called operant behavior}

If after the operant (key pecking) has been conditioned, the pigeon no
longer receives food when it pecks, the rate of emitting responses decreases
until it reaches the low rate which prevailed before conditioning. This
process is called extinction.

‘When referring to behavior, generally, rather than to specific instances of it, we use the
term operant, e.g., key pecking is an operant; but for speciﬁc instances, we use the term
response, e.g., a peck on the key is a response. (Reﬂex behavior, which we have already
studied, is call-ed respondent behavior. It occurs only in response to eliciting stimuli.)
