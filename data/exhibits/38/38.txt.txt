EXPERIMENT 1.

(A) Eight rats were reinforced with food on a Ô¨Åxed-interval schedule for
pressing a lever.

(B) After three daily sessions of 1 hour each, food reinforcement was dis-
continued. Responses made without reinforcement were recorded for
two sessions of 2 hours each.

(C) For four rats, the apparatus was so arranged that each lever-pressing
response during the first 10 minutes of extinction resulted in a slap on
the forepaws by a return kick of the lever.

(D) After 10 minutes, the rats were no longer slapped.
(E) The other four rats were not slapped at all.

(F) The averaged cumulative records for the two groups of rats for the
two extinction sessions are presented in Figure 1.

EXPERIMENT 2.

(Wait until instructed to read Experiment 2.)

(G) A group of new rats were treated like the punished group in Experiment
1 until the extinction session.

(H) For the first 10 minutes in extinction, every response was followed
byaslap.

(1) After this short period of punishment, each rat was left in the box for
2 hours, but the lever was removed.

(J) Two hours later, the lever was replaced and extinction continued with
no further slapping of the forepaws.

(K) Except for a very slight initial depression in rate,

(L) the extinction curve was like that for the unpunished rats in Experiment 1.
