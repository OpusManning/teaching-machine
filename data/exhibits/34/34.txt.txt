EXPERIMENT 1.

A rat is placed in a standard experimental box, the floor of which is an electric
grid through which the rat can be shocked. A brief shock occurs every 8 seconds
unless the rat presses a lever; such a response postpones the shock for a full 8
seconds. The rat is shocked whenever it fails to emit a response within 8 seconds
after the previous response or shock. The animal has been under the same con-
tingencies for many sessions. (White space has been cut out of the record and the
separate segments brought together to facilitate reproduction.) Occasional shocks
are indicated by the short downward movements of the pen (not to be confused
with the fragments of the reset lines).

EXPERIMENT 2. (Do not read Experiment 2 until instructed to do so.)

In a standard apparatus a food-deprived pigeon pecked a key which delivered
food on a variable-interval schedule when an S" (lighted key) was present. In S-3
responses produced no food. A second key was also present. \/Vhenever the pigeon
failed to respond on this key for a certain interval of time (2 minutes in first part of
Figure 2 and 45 seconds in second part), S3 appeared for 1 minute on the food-
reinforcement key. This procedure had been in effect for several days before data
in Figure 2 were collected. In Figure 2 a point has been plotted for each session
showing the total number of responses on the key which postponed S—‘. On days 2
and 12 (open circles) no S35 were presented whether or not the pigeon responded.
