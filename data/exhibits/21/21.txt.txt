PHASE 1.

A hungry pigeon was
conditioned to peck the
key in the usual way.
The behavior was main-
tained in short daily ses-
sions for four weeks by
reinforcing every 25th
response. During this
time, the key was illu-
minated by a red or a
green light. The key
changed color after each
reinforcement. Figure 1
is the cumulative record
for the last session on the
procedure. Hatch marks
indicate reinforcement.

PHASE 2.

When the key was red, a reinforcement followed every 25th response as
before. However, after each reinforcement the key turned green for 2 minutes
during which no response was reinforced. After 2 minutes the key again
turned red, and the 25th response was reinforced. The key then turned
green, etc.

The behavior was recorded for alternate periods of red and green lights on
two cumulative recorders. Figure 2 is the cumulative record of responses
made to the red key. The paper moved only while the key was red. Hatch
marks indicate reinforcements.

Figure 3 is the cumulative record of responses to the green key only during
2-minute periods alternating with the red periods of Figure 2. Responses to
the green light were not reinforced; the hatch marks on this record indicate
when the key was red (this recorder being stopped until the pigeon emitted
25 responses recorded in Figure 2).
