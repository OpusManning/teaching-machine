When every response is reinforced, we speak of continuous reinforcement.
Often, however, an operant is reinforced only occasionally, that is, reinforce-
ment is intermittent. In one type of intermittent reinforcement, a response
is reinforced only after a certain number of responses have been emitted
(ratio reinforcement). In another type, a response is reinforced only after
a certain time has passed (interval reinforcement). A given schedule is pro-
grammed by apparatus composed of timers, counters, relays, etc.

F ood-deprived pigeons were reinforced with food for pecking a key in a
standard experimental box. Typical portions of actual cumulative records
are given to show the rate, and changes in rate, at which each pigeon pecked
the key under various schedules of reinforcement.

EXPERIMENT 1.

A fixed-interval schedule. The experi-
mental equipment includes a timer which
starts just after reinforcement. After 10
minutes has elapsed, the key and maga-
zine are connected and the next response
is reinforced. Responses during the 10-
minute interval are not reinforced.
