Many highly skilled forms of behavior, e.g., drawing pictures, singing, etc.,
require a continuous repertoire —— a set of responses differing from one another
only very slightly (when the response ﬁeld is said to be continuous) and
under the control of discriminative stimuli also differing from one another
only very slightly (when the stimulus ﬁeld is said to be continuous). In
drawing a straight line with a given slope, the response
ﬁeld is composed of all the movements which produce
an indeﬁnitely large family of lines:

In copying a straight line with a given slope, the
stimuli are a similar family of lines. With an adequate
repertoire, the subject can draw a line with a slope close
to any slope given to him to be copied. Differences between slopes can be
as small as desired. In the same way, a good singer can sing a pitch which
corresponds to a pitch he hears, where both stimulus and response ﬁelds
are also practically continuous.

Many such skills are shaped quite gradually during the individual’s life.
The contingencies may be arranged in formal training (as in art or music
instruction, driver training, etc.) or left to the vicissitudes of the environment.
Once a child has acquired the ability to be reinforced when the “produced
stimulus” matches the “stimulus to be copied:’ shaping may proceed without
the frequent intervention of another person. Learning includes (1) discrimi-
nating subtle differences among stimuli to be imitated (in the continuous
stimulus field) and (2) discriminating among those stimuli produced and
(3) executing movements showing subtle differences of the continuous
response ﬁeld.
