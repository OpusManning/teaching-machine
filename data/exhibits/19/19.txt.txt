EXPERIMENT 1.
A fixed-interval schedule.

EXPERIMENT 2.

A variable-interval schedule.
The experimental equipment is
arranged so that a response is re-
inforced after an interval of time,
which may vary from a few sec-
onds to 6 minutes, measured from
the previous reinforcement. The
average interval is 3 minutes.

EXPERIMENT 3.

A fixed-ratio schedule. Rein-
forcement occurs only at the 210th
(Record A) or the 900th response
(Record B) after the preceding
reinforcement. (Such large ratios
can be reached only by beginning
with smaller ratios and gradually
increasing them.)

EXPERIMENT 4.

Resistance to extinction varies with the type of schedule to which the
organism has been conditioned. Operants maintained by continuous rein-
forcement extinguish rapidly when reinforcement is discontinued (the organ-
ism seldom emits more than a few hundred unreinforced responses Operants
maintained by intermittent reinforcement take considerably longer to extin-
guish. For example, in one experiment, after the response had been main-
tained on a fixed ratio of 900 and reinforcement was then discontinued, the
pigeon emitted 73,000 responses during the first 4% hours of extinction.
