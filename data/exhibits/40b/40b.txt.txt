EXPERIMENT 2.

(C) At the end of Experiment 1 punishment was discontinued. For the first
few sessions, the rate of responding was actually higher than before
punishment was introduced.

(H) After several sessions without punishment, the rate of responding
dropped to the original level and again became stable. The cumulative
record from the last day of this period without punishment is shown
in Figure 2 labeled “N o Punishment.”

(1) Each response was then followed by a shock as in Experiment 1, but
a moderately strong shock was used, 50 volts instead of the milder 80
volts. Cumulative records from many days under this procedure are
shown in Figure 2 (Days: one through thirty-two).
