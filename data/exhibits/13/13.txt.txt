EXPERIMENT 1.

Preliminary treatment. A food-deprived pigeon is placed for the first time
in a standard experimental box, and the feeding mechanism is operated
by the experimenter from time to time. When the mechanism operates, there
is a loud click. When first placed in the box, and for the first several clicks
of the mechanism, the pigeon may jump, ﬂap its wings, and rush about.
After a while, this “emotional” behavior ceases. We say that adaptation has
taken place. The pigeon eventually learns to turn toward and approach the
feeding mechanism, or food magazine, whenever it hears the click.

Conditioned key pecking. A plastic disk is now attached behind a circular
opening in the wall of the box above the feeding mechanism. The disk acts
as an electric key. When the pigeon pecks the key, a circuit is closed causing
the feeding mechanism to operate. (The experimenter no longer operates
the mechanism.) Cumulative records of all responses to the key are made.
Two examples are shown in Figures 1A and 1B. All responses were reinforced,
but the usual sideward movements of the pen to indicate reinforcement
are ‘omitted.

EXPERIMENT 2.

An inexperienced pigeon is placed in the box. No preliminary magazine
training is given, that is, no attempt is made to adapt the pigeon to the
box and the click, or to establish the click as a conditioned reinforcer. The
key is connected to the feeding mechanism from the start. The cumulative
record is shown in Figure 2.

“THE LEARNING CURVE”

Early investigators observed organisms in puzzle boxes, mazes, and similar
situations. They measured successive delays in responding and plotted these
in a “learning curve,” believing that they
were plotting the course of a basic learn-
ing process. Experiment 2 (Pigeon C) is
comparable.

Plotted on the right are the delays be-
tween successive reinforced responses on
the key.
