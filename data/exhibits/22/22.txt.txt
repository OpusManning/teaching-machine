A stimulus present when a response is emitted and reinforced becomes a

discriminative stimulus (SD). In the future, the response is relatively likely

to be emitted when this stimulus is present. Other stimuli having something
in common with SD are also effective, but produce a lower response fre-
quency. The spread of controlling power to other stimuli is called stimulus
generalization.

EXPERIMENT

Phase 1. A pigeon is placed in a standard experimental box. A yellowish-
green light with a wavelength of 550 millimicrons is constantly projected on
the key. The l<eyâ€”pecking response, shaped in the usual way, is reinforced
on a variable-interval schedule, the average interval between reinforcements
being 1 minute. This schedule generates a steady rate of responding and,
more important here, a considerable resistance to extinction.

Phase 2. Reinforcement is discontin-
ued, and during extinction the color of
the light projected on the key is changed
at short, regular intervals. Each of six-
teen colors, 10 millimicrons apart, is
presented many times in random order
and for the same total time per color.
The responses emitted by the pigeon
in the presence of each wavelength
(color) are counted and plotted in the
figure on the right. The resulting func-
tion is called stimulus generalization
gradient.
