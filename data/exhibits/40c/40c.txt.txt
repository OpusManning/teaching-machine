EXPERIMENT 3.

(J)

A pigeon was reinforced with
food on a 1-minute Variable-interval
schedule. A moderately intense
shock followed each response, as in
Experiment 2.

Halfway through a session, punish-
ment was abruptly discontinued for
10 minutes and then reinstated. The

cumulative record is shown in Fig-

ure 8.
