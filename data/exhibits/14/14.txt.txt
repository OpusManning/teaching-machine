The experimenter places several pigeons in separate experimental boxes.
A food magazine delivers a small amount of food to each pigeon every 15
seconds regardless of what the pigeon is doing. When the experimenter
returns later, he ﬁnds one bird sitting very still, another hopping from one
foot to the other, another bowing, another turning around and around,
another raising and lowering its head, etc. Each bird continues to repeat
its own “ritual” between deliveries of food.
