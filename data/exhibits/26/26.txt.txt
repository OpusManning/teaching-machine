A White rat is placed in a standard experimental space having a horizontal
bar protruding from one Wall. The rat has been deprived of food for 24
hours. Pressing the bar operates a food magazine which drops a small

Â»

(1/15 grain) pellet of food into a tray.

The rat has previously been adapted
to the box and to the sound of the
magazine and has been reinforced many
times for pressing the bar.

As an experimental session progresses,
the rat ingests more and more pellets,
becomes less food deprived or closer to
being satiated with food. The cumula-
tive record of bar presses is presented
below.
